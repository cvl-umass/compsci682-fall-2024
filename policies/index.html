              <p>Check this page throughout the semester.</p>
            </div>
          </div>


          <h2>Assignments</h2>
          <p>
          Assignments are due just before midnight, at 11:55pm, unless otherwise specified. You will hand in the assignments electronically through <a href="https://gradescope.com/">gradescope</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          <b>Late day policy</b>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Free late days:</b>
          You can use 7 late days in total, with up to 3 late days for one assignment. Beyond 3 late days the assignment will not be counted at all.
          Once you have used all 7 late days, penalty is 25% for each additional late day.
          We will use your latest submission for grading and for calculating your late day usage.
          There is no bonus if you don't use late days at all.
          There is no need to ask for permission for late days – we will automatically figure late days based on the latest gradescope submissions. Delay of even a single minute counts as a full late day, so do not wait till the last minute to submit.</li>
          <li><b>Documented late days:</b> Beyond the seven “free” late days, we will only provide “verified” late days as required by university policy, with documentation (i.e. illness documented by a doctors note).</li>
          <li><b>Undocumented late days:</b> If you submit your homework late for any reason not covered by the above two policies, you may include at the top of your submission a justification for why it was submitted late. When assigning grades at the end of the semester, the instructor will consider all these justifications and may, at his sole discretion, waive some or all of the penalties applied. The instructor may also waive penalties for submissions that are only very slightly late (e.g. 15 seconds after the deadline). No feedback will be given before the end of the semester about how these decisions will be made. Please make sure to include this in the submission itself and not, e.g., by emailing the instructor.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Re-grading policy:</b> Errors in grading of assignments and exams can occur despite the best efforts of the course staff. If you believe you’ve found a grading error, submit a re-grade request on gradescope. Re-grade requests must be submitted no later than one week after the assignment is returned. Note that re-grading may result in your original grade increasing or decreasing as appropriate.
          <p>

          <h2>AUDIT and SAT/UNSAT</h2>

          <p>Audits are not permitted. Students must decide on SAT/UNSAT grading by November 15.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Rationale:</b> Due to the high demand for seats in this class, our priority is to accommodate students who are committed to earning graded credits. As such, auditing is not allowed. Decisions regarding SAT/UNSAT grading must be communicated to us by November 15, which is expected to be shortly after the release of Assignment 2 grades. Bear in mind that by this deadline, a significant portion of your final grade will still be undetermined. If you foresee challenges dedicating time during the latter half of the course, it might be best to enroll in a different semester. No exceptions will be made.
          </p>

          <h2>Use of AI is not permitted</h2>
          <p>
            This course assumes that all work submitted by students will be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups as directed by assignment instructions.
            Students should not have another person/entity do the writing of any portion of an assignment for them, which includes hiring a person or a company to write assignments and using artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and Copilot.
         </p>
